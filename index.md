## Motivation
Like its predecessors, the 23rd Automotive Software Engineering Workshop (ASE 2026) focuses on the challenges of software development in the automotive domain and addresses suitable methods, techniques, and tools.
With increasingly connected vehicles, modern driver assistance functions, and the ongoing challenges related to highly and fully automated driving, automotive software plays a more central role than ever before. In addition to the steadily growing functional complexity, ever stricter requirements regarding reliability, functional safety, IT security, and data protection must be met.
Moreover, intuitive and multimodal human–machine interaction (through speech, gestures, or personalized interfaces) continues to gain importance. The trend toward comprehensive connectivity and digitalization within vehicles is advancing rapidly: value-added services such as social media, streaming, or office applications are increasingly being integrated and can be used safely and context-sensitively even while driving.
The workshop provides a forum for researchers and practitioners to discuss current challenges and solution approaches in automotive software engineering. A particular focus will be placed on the use of agile methods in regulated environments. Contributions from all areas of software development for modern vehicles are explicitly invited.

## Goals

This workshop will discuss challenges and approaches to solutions in automotive software engineering. Contributions from all areas of software development for modern vehicles are welcome. The workshop is aimed equally at researchers, developers, and users from the automotive industry, as well as scientists from research institutes and universities working in automotive software engineering. The focus is traditionally less on theoretical and more on practical work.
