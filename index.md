## Motivation
Like its predecessors, the 22nd Automotive Software Engineering Workshop addresses the problems of software development in the automotive sector and, consequently, suitable methods, techniques and tools. With the trend towards software-defined vehicles and the associated development of increasingly networked vehicles and modern driver assistance functions, software plays a more important role in vehicles today than ever before. In addition to the ever-increasing complexity, increasingly stringent requirements for reliability, security (security and safety) and data protection (privacy) must be met. Furthermore, the distraction-free and intuitive, multimodal operation of vehicle applications using voice and gesture control is playing an increasingly important role. The trend towards connectivity has long since reached the vehicle. Driving is thus being changed by advancing ‘digital cultures’: Value-added services (e.g. social media, charging station and car park search) will be even more consistently integrated into the vehicle and can then be operated by the user while driving. In this workshop, challenges and solutions of Automotive Software Engineering will be discussed. Of particular interest is the topic of cybersecurity in the vehicle. 
Contributions from all areas of software development for modern vehicles are welcome.

## Goals

This workshop will discuss challenges and approaches to solutions in automotive software engineering. Contributions from all areas of software development for modern vehicles are welcome. The workshop is aimed equally at researchers, developers, and users from the automotive industry, as well as scientists from research institutes and universities working in automotive software engineering. The focus is traditionally less on theoretical and more on practical work.
